A weekly diet must have AT LEAST 14000 calories, 350g protein, 140 mcg vitamin D, 9100 mg calcium, 126 mg iron, 32900 mg potassium, and AT MOST 35000 mg of sodium. The five variables will be eggs, granola, yogurt, shrimp, and vegetables. A serving of eggs has 70 calories, 70 mg sodium, 6 g protein, 1 mcg vitamin D, 30 mg calcium, 0.9 mg iron, 70 mg potassium, and costs $0.31 per serving. A serving of granola has 160 calories, 60 mg sodium, 4 g protein, 0 mcg vitamin D, 30 mg of calcium, 1.1 mg of iron, 150 g potassium, and costs $0.50 per serving. A serving of yogurt has 100 calories, 60 mg sodium, 18g protein, 0 mcg vitamin D, 190 mg of calcium, 0 mg of iron, 190g potassium, and costs $0.87 per serving. A serving of shrimp has 90 calories, 310 mg sodium, 22 g protein, 0 mcg vitamin D, 50 mg calcium, 0 mg iron, 125 mg potassium, and costs $1.86 per serving. A serving of vegetables has 120 calories, 860 mg sodium, 6 g protein, 0 mcg vitamin D, 60 mg calcium, 1.6 mg iron, 220 mg potassium, and costs $1 per serving.

Can you provide me the code to solve this linear programming problem using the pulp library in Python?

Here’s the Python code using the pulp library to solve your linear programming problem:

python
Copy
Edit
from pulp import LpMinimize, LpProblem, LpVariable, lpSum

# Create the LP problem
problem = LpProblem("Minimize_Diet_Cost", LpMinimize)

# Decision variables (servings of eggs, granola, yogurt, shrimp, vegetables)
eggs = LpVariable("Eggs", lowBound=0, cat="Continuous")
granola = LpVariable("Granola", lowBound=0, cat="Continuous")
yogurt = LpVariable("Yogurt", lowBound=0, cat="Continuous")
shrimp = LpVariable("Shrimp", lowBound=0, cat="Continuous")
vegetables = LpVariable("Vegetables", lowBound=0, cat="Continuous")

# Cost coefficients
costs = {
    eggs: 0.31,
    granola: 0.50,
    yogurt: 0.87,
    shrimp: 1.86,
    vegetables: 1.00,
}

# Objective function: Minimize cost
problem += lpSum([costs[var] * var for var in costs])

# Nutritional constraints
problem += 70 * eggs + 160 * granola + 100 * yogurt + 90 * shrimp + 120 * vegetables >= 14000, "Calories"
problem += 70 * eggs + 60 * granola + 60 * yogurt + 310 * shrimp + 860 * vegetables <= 35000, "Sodium"
problem += 6 * eggs + 4 * granola + 18 * yogurt + 22 * shrimp + 6 * vegetables >= 350, "Protein"
problem += 1 * eggs + 0 * granola + 0 * yogurt + 0 * shrimp + 0 * vegetables >= 140, "Vitamin_D"
problem += 30 * eggs + 30 * granola + 190 * yogurt + 50 * shrimp + 60 * vegetables >= 9100, "Calcium"
problem += 0.9 * eggs + 1.1 * granola + 0 * yogurt + 0 * shrimp + 1.6 * vegetables >= 126, "Iron"
problem += 70 * eggs + 150 * granola + 190 * yogurt + 125 * shrimp + 220 * vegetables >= 32900, "Potassium"

# Solve the problem
problem.solve()

# Print results
print("Optimal Solution:")
for var in [eggs, granola, yogurt, shrimp, vegetables]:
    print(f"{var.name}: {var.varValue:.2f}")

print(f"Total Cost: ${problem.objective.value():.2f}")
How to Run:
Install the pulp library if you haven’t already:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pulp
Copy and paste the code into a Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
Run the script, and it will output the optimal servings for each food item and the minimum cost.
